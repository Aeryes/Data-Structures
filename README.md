# Data-Structures
This project shows examples of commonly seen data structures in the Python programming language. The aim of this repo is to provide people who are learning the Python programming language an easy to use reference for the most common data structures that can be seen.
Currently the data structures that are present in this repo are as follows:
- Stack

Data structures are a very important part of learning a programming langauge. These structures allow you to create more robust programs that perform better and consume less memory. By studying these data structures you can take the first steps towards learning more advanced data structures and algorithms.
